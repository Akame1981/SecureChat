## What is Whispr?

Whispr is a **secure messaging app** that keeps your conversations completely private. Unlike other messaging apps, Whispr encrypts everything on your device before sending it, so even the server can't read your messages. 

**Key Benefits:**
- üîí **Complete Privacy**: All messages encrypted end-to-end
- üí¨ **Direct Messages**: Private 1-on-1 conversations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**"Can't connect to server"**

**"Messages not arriving"**

- Previous message history will be lost

**"App running slowly"**
- Close other applications that use lots of memory
