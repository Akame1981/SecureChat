| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| 1    | **User 1** copies and sends their public key to **User 2**                         | Key shared successfully                                      | ✅ Works                                                                             | ✅           |
| 2    | **User 2** clicks **“Add Recipient”**, pastes User 1’s key, and names him “User 1” | Recipient should appear in list as *User 1*                  | ✅ Appears correctly                                                                 | ✅           |
| 3    | **User 2** opens chat with *User 1* and sends “hey”                                | Message sent and received correctly                          | ✅ Delivered                                                                         | ✅           |
| 4    | **User 1** receives message                                                        | Should appear from “Unknown-<id>” since User 2 not added yet | ✅ Shows as “Unknown-315d87”                                                         | ✅           |

| 6    | **User 1** asks for User 2’s public key to add back                                | Should be able to add from main screen via “Add Recipient”   | ❌ Not possible, “Add Recipient” fails (User 2 is already a recipient automatically) | ⚠️ UX Issue |

---

## 🧩 Findings

### ✅ Working
- Public key exchange and verification.
- Message routing between known ↔ unknown users.
- Correct fallback to “Unknown-xxxxx” naming.

### ⚠️ Not Intended / UX Issues
- User cannot **easily rename unknown recipients**.  
  → Requires going into *Settings → Edit Recipient*, which is not intuitive.
- User cannot **add an unknown sender** directly from chat or main view.  
  → Ideally, they should be able to add them from the chat screen or via the “Add Recipient” button.

## 🧠 Suggested Fixes

| Issue                                     | Suggested Solution                                                                                                |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Hard-to-find rename option                | Add a “Rename” or “Save Contact” button in the chat header when chatting with an unknown user.                    |
| “Add Recipient” fails for unknown senders | Allow adding unknown users by pasting their public key or via contextual button (“Add this contact”).             |
| Confusing UX flow                         | On first message from unknown user, display a small banner: “You’re chatting with Unknown-315d87. [Add Contact].” |

## 📊 Test Summary

| Category | Result |
|-----------|--------|
| Public Key Exchange | ✅ |
| Message Delivery | ✅ |
| Unknown Sender Labeling | ✅ |
| Rename Function | ⚠️ Manual only |
| Add Unknown via UI | ⚠️ Not working |
| Overall UX Flow | ⚠️ Needs improvement |

---

## 🚀 Conclusion

The **core cryptographic flow** (public key linking + message exchange) works perfectly.  
However, **user experience** for adding and renaming unknown contacts is unintuitive and needs refinement.

**Recommended Priority:** 🟡 Medium — Functionality OK, UX confusing.
