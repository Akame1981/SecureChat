## 🧾 Summary

**Feature:** Text Message Handling / Extreme Length  
**Status:** ⚠️ Partial / Failure on Extreme Size  
**Test Date:** 2025-10-12  
**Tester:** Oktay Mehmed  
**Build:** Post-Fix #6 (Message Rendering & Transmission)

---

## 🎯 Objective

Verify that Whispr can handle very long text messages, and assess the limits of the message transmission and rendering system.

---

## 🧪 Test Steps

### Step 1: Large but Reasonable Message

1. **User 1** sends a text message:  
   - 113 paragraphs  
   - 10,000 words  
   - 67,951 bytes  

2. **User 2** receives the message.  

**Result:**  
- ✅ Message delivered and rendered correctly.  
- ✅ No performance or crash issues.  

**Conclusion:**  
- Whispr handles ~10k-word messages reliably.

---

### Step 2: Extreme Message

1. **User 1** sends a text message:  
   - 100,000 words  
   - ~667.98 KB  

2. **Observation:**  
- **User 1 crashes immediately**  
```
X Error of failed request: BadValue (integer parameter out of range for operation)  
Major opcode of failed request: 53 (X_CreatePixmap)  
Value in failed request: 0x0  
Serial number of failed request: 69424  
Current serial number in output stream: 69449
```

- **User 2** does not receive the message.  

**Conclusion:**  
- Crash is due to GUI/X11 resource allocation limits (`X_CreatePixmap`) when attempting to render extremely large text.  
- Message never reaches the receiver because the sender app crashes before sending completes.

## 🧩 Observations

| Metric | 10k Words | 100k Words |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| Message Size | 67,951 bytes | 667.98 KB |
| Delivery | ✅ Works | ❌ Fails |
| Rendering | ✅ Works | ❌ Sender crashes |
| Receiver | ✅ Works | ❌ Receives nothing |
| GUI Error | — | `BadValue (X_CreatePixmap)` |

---

## 🧠 Root Cause Analysis

- **Crash Source:** X11 server / GUI toolkit (Tkinter/CustomTkinter) cannot create pixmaps large enough for a huge Text widget.  
- **Message Loss:** Sender crashes before network transmission completes.  
- **Underlying Limits:** Tkinter and X11 are not optimized for rendering hundreds of kilobytes of text in a single widget.

---

## 🛠 Fixes

1. **File Fallback**  
 - For extremely long text (>50–100 KB), suggest sending as `.txt` attachment instead of chat.  

---

## 📊 Test Summary

| Test Scenario | Pass / Fail | Notes |
|---------------|------------|-------|
| 10k-word message | ✅ Pass | Delivered and rendered correctly |
| 100k-word message | ❌ Fail | Sender crashes; receiver never receives |

---

## 🚀 Conclusion

- Whispr can safely handle messages of ~10k words (~68 KB).  
- Extremely large messages (~100k words, 668 KB) **cause crashes due to GUI limitations**.  
- Fix requires **chunking, virtualized rendering, or file attachment fallback** for extremely long messages.

# 📝 Whispr Long Message Stress Test Report (v2 — Final)

## 🧾 Summary

**Feature:** Text Message Handling / Extreme Length  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed and Verified  
**Test Date:** 2025-10-12  
**Tester:** Oktay Mehmed  
**Build:** Post-Fix #7 (File Fallback for Large Messages)

---

## 🎯 Objective

Verify that Whispr can handle very long text messages safely using **file fallback**, and ensure reliable delivery and rendering without crashing.

---

## 🧪 Test Steps

### Step 1: Large but Reasonable Message

- **User 1** sends a text message:  
  - 113 paragraphs, 10,000 words (~68 KB)  
- **User 2** receives it.  

**Result:**  
- ✅ Delivered and rendered correctly  
- ✅ No performance or crash issues  

---

### Step 2: Extreme Message with File Fallback

- **User 1** attempts to send 100,000 words (~668 KB)  
- **System behavior:**  
  - Message automatically converted to `.txt` attachment  
  - User 2 receives the attachment  
  - No crashes occur  

**Result:**  
- ✅ Sender app stable  
- ✅ Receiver sees file rendered correctly  
- ✅ Message delivery completed successfully  

---

## 🧩 Observations

| Metric | Before Fix | After File Fallback |
|--------|------------|-------------------|
| Message Size | 100,000 words (~668 KB) | Same |
| Sender Crash | ❌ Crashed (X_CreatePixmap) | ✅ Stable |
| Receiver Delivery | ❌ Not received | ✅ Received as attachment |
| Viewer Rendering | ❌ N/A | ✅ File preview rendered correctly |

---

## 🧠 Root Cause of Original Issue

- **GUI / X11 Limitations:** Large text widgets created huge pixmaps → X server error.  
- **Message Loss:** Sender crashed before network transmission.  

**Fix:** Introduced **automatic file fallback** for messages exceeding safe size (e.g., >50 KB).

---

---

## 📊 Test Summary

| Test Scenario | Status | Notes |
|---------------|--------|-------|
| 10k-word message | ✅ Pass | Delivered as normal chat text |
| 100k-word message | ✅ Pass | Automatically sent as `.txt` attachment; stable |

---

## 🚀 Conclusion

- **Issue Resolved:** Large text messages no longer crash sender or fail to deliver.  
- **UX Stable:** File fallback provides safe, predictable handling of extremely long messages.  
- **Next Steps:** None required for this scenario; feature considered stable.
