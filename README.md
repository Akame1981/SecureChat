# ðŸ”’ SecureChat

**SecureChat** is a simple yet powerful end-to-end encrypted chat application built with **FastAPI**, **PyNaCl**, and **Tkinter**.  
It allows users to send encrypted messages securely between public keys, store recipients, and manage encryption keys locally.

Running the App
Start the FastAPI server

uvicorn main:app --reload
The server will run at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

Launch the GUI client

python client.py
client.py is the Tkinter chat client. It will ask for a PIN to unlock or generate your private key.

Manage Recipients: Add, delete, or choose recipients from the Settings menu.

Key Management: Generate new keypairs or change your PIN for encryption.

Copy Public Key: Share your public key to receive messages.

All messages are encrypted end-to-end using SealedBox.

Private keys are encrypted locally with a PIN-based secret using SecretBox.

Server only stores encrypted messages, never plaintext.
